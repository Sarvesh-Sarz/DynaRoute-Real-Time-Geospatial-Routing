# The PRIMARY check is distance to the nearest actual network node -- this
# directly answers "can we route from here?" and doesn't depend on the
# shape of any polygon. This matters because real OSM road extracts are
# often not fully connected; after to_largest_component() keeps only the
# single largest connected chunk, the network's true coverage can be
# noticeably smaller (or a different shape) than the whole visible map --
# so a point that looks perfectly central on the map can genuinely be far
# from any node that survived that pruning step.
#
# The convex-hull polygon is kept as a SECONDARY, more permissive check
# (mostly useful for a compact/synthetic network), and as something you can
# render on the map to see the network's actual coverage.
